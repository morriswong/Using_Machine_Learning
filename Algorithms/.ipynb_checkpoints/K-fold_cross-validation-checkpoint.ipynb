    "\n",
    "#### Steps for cross-validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dataset is split into K \"folds\" of equal size\n",
    "- Each fold acts as the testing set 1 time, and acts as the training set K-1 times\n",
    "- Average testing performance is used as the estimate of out-of-sample performance\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits of cross-validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- More reliable estimate of out-of-sample performance than train/test split\n",
    "- Can be used for selecting tuning parameters, choosing between models, and selecting features\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Drawbacks of cross-validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can be computationally expensive"
